# Introduction to the Open Weather Map API

<!-- outline / structure notes -->

### Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you will be familiar with:

* How to get started using a public API
* Incorporating the Open Weather Map API in your own sample project
* The capabilities of the Open Weather API

<!-- #### Opening
* Capture reader interest.
* What is this post about?
* What will readers know or be able to do by the end of the tutorial? What are the goals?
* Examples: demonstration, story, problem to solve -->

The OpenWeatherMap API provides robust and easy-to-use weather data through a public API. With both free and subscription services, this tool provides developers access to a vast set data that is straightforward to incorporate into their own projects. From simple weather status results to complex data visualizations, OpenWeatherMap has an API that can handle it.

Today, we'll build a small static site using vanilla JavaScript, HMTL, and CSS that displays city-specific weather data from OWMs Current Weather Data API.

<!-- #### Introduction to New Material (I do)
* Writer explains, shows, or demonstrates
* Examples: code demonstration -->


<!-- #### Guided Practice (We do)
* Writer and reader both "doing" -->


<!-- #### Independent/Pair Practice (You do)
* Reader "doing", writer providing guidance
* Examples: questions in a Gist, implementing feature -->


<!-- ### Possible questions and/or misunderstandings
* What concepts might be misunderstand, and why? -->

It's worth noting that it isn't a best practice to share an API key publicly as we've done in this tutorial -- we can get away with it while working locally and experimenting with how to play with data, but if this were a live site doing so would present security risks. This type of private data is typically found in a project's server-side code, which our small site does not have. If you're interested in making a static site like this live on a platform such as GitHub Pages, take a look at a tool like Firebase. If this is something you're interested in exploring, [this blog post](https://medium.com/pan-labs/dynamic-web-apps-on-github-pages-for-free-ffac2b776d45) can point you in the right direction.

<!-- #### The Closing
* Check for understanding
* Discuss any clarifications or student misconceptions
* Review goals, further resources, and next steps -->
